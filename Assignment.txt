PySpark ETL Pipeline

Goal:	

    Align with the Python work to process large sales data using PySpark and generate enriched insights.	

Tasks:	

    Read raw CSVs from HDFS or local folder.	

    Transform and clean the data (handle missing values, duplicates, etc.).	

    Enrich data by calculating KPIs such as:	
        Monthly Revenue
        Profit Margin (%)
        Region-wise Sales6
        Average Order Value
        (Come up with 3–4 more KPIs as needed)

    Write aggregated results to Parquet or a managed table.	

    (Optional) Integrate with Kafka for streaming order ingestion.	

    Tech: PySpark, HDFS, Kafka (optional)	

    Deliverables: PySpark script or notebook + pipeline diagram + screenshots (Spark job output, DAG view, Parquet output sample)
